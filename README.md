# chrono-watcher
This is an activity logger that I created to keep track of how I spend my time. I already do something like this daily using an Excel spreadsheet, and I thought it would be fun to try to make a web app version of it. This is built using the MERN stack.

## Install Scripts

In the project directory, assuming you have Node installed, you can run:

### `npm install && npm client-install && npm run dev`

This installs dependencies and runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
